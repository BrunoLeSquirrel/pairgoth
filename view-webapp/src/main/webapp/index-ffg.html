  <h1>Welcome to <span class="logo">pairgoth</span>, your Go Pairing Engine!</h1>
  <h2>What is <span class="logo">pairgoth</span>?</h2>
  <p><span class="logo">pairgoth</span> is a Go tournament pairing engine designed to make your tournament experience effortless. <span class="logo">pairgoth</span> is the successor of <a href="https://github.com/lucvannier/opengotha">opengotha</a>, the well known pairing system software developed by <a href="http://vannier.info/jeux/accueil.htm">Luc Vannier</a> and uses the same algorithm internally, as well as import and export features towards its format.</p>
  <p><span class="logo">pairgoth</span> version 0.1 supports the <b>Swiss</b></a> pairing system, ideal for championships with no handicap games, as well as the <b>MacMahon</b> pairing system, more suited for classical tournaments and cups. It is still in a beta stage. Future versions will support more pairing systems and more features. <a href="mailto:pairgoth@jeudego.org">Your feedback is most welcome!</a></p>
