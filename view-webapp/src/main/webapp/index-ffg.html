  <h1>Welcome to <span class="logo">pairgoth</span>, your Go Pairing Engine!</h1>
  <h2>What is <span class="logo">pairgoth</span>?</h2>
  <p>At its core, <span class="logo">pairgoth</span> is a versatile Go tournament pairing engine designed to make your tournament experience effortless. <span class="logo">pairgoth</span> is the successor of <a href="https://github.com/lucvannier/opengotha">opengotha</a>, the well known pairing system software developed by <a href="http://vannier.info/jeux/accueil.htm">Luc Vannier</a> and uses the same algorithm internally, as well as import and export features towards its format.</p>
  <p><span class="logo">pairgoth</span> version 1.0-BETA supports the <b>Swiss</b></a> pairing system, ideal for championships with no handicap games, as well as the <b>MacMahon</b> pairing system, more suited for classical tournaments and cups.</p>
  <p>Future versions will support more pairing systems and more features. <a href="mailto:pairgoth@jeudego.org">Your feedback is welcome!</a></p>
  <h2>How to use <span class="logo">pairgoth</span>?</h2>
  <p>We offer you the flexibility to use <span class="logo">pairgoth</span> in a way that best suits your needs. Here are your options:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <p><b>Stay in the browser</b>: If you prefer convenience, you can simply use the <span class="logo">pairgoth</span> instance graciously hosted by the French Go Federation.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <a class="nobreak" href="https://pairgoth.jeudego.org/menu.html">Launch <span class="logo">pairgoth</span></a>
      </blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>
      <p><b>Launch a standalone instance</b>: This mode allows you to run <span class="logo">pairgoth</span> on your local computer.</p>
